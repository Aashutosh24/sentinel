"""
Shared mixins applied to every ingested-dataset model.

Adjustment vs. the originally approved architecture (documented in the
Phase 1 report, item D1): the approved architecture specified UUID
primary keys + created_by/updated_by audit columns on every table. Once
the real datasets arrived, every one of them ships its own globally
unique, stable, human-readable natural key (EMP0001, CTRL-53203, ...)
and is populated by bulk ingestion jobs rather than individual user
actions. Introducing a surrogate UUID and a user-attribution column
would add a translation layer with no Phase 1 benefit — so ingested
tables use the natural source ID as the primary key, and
`ingestion_job_id` (not `created_by`) as their provenance column, which
is the more meaningful attribution for a bulk-loaded row. Platform-
internal tables we invented ourselves (users, ingestion_jobs) still use
UUIDs, per the original architecture, since they have no natural key.
