Compliance Copilot — Phase 2B, Priority 3.

    question -> intent -> intelligence service -> structured answer

Every answer is composed from live database aggregates via the existing
intelligence services — intent matching, entity-id extraction and every
number in `supporting_data` / `related_entities` / `recommendations` /
`sources` are still 100% deterministic and traceable to a row, LLM or not.

An optional LLM explanation layer (`app.services.llm_service.LLMService`)
may rewrite only the prose `answer` field afterwards, grounded strictly in
that same deterministic result — it cannot see raw database rows and cannot
change the structured fields. `answer()` reports which happened:

    engine="llm_grounded_v1"          llm_used=True   LLM call succeeded
    engine="deterministic_fallback_v1" llm_used=False  matched intent, no
                                                         LLM (unconfigured,
                                                         timed out, errored,
                                                         or returned nothing)
    engine="deterministic_intent_v1"   llm_used=False  no intent matched
                                                         (the LLM is never
                                                         invoked for this
                                                         case — see below)

## Why intent routing and not a chatbot

The brief asks for an enterprise GRC copilot, not a ChatGPT clone. A fixed
intent set means every supported question has a known data path and a known
failure mode: if nothing matches, the Copilot says so and lists what it can
answer, rather than improvising — and skips the LLM call entirely, since
there is no verified context to ground it in. Unmatched questions return
`intent: "unknown"` with `confidence: "none"` — never a plausible-sounding
guess.

## Service reuse

Nothing here recomputes Trust, Risk, Evidence or Policy logic. It calls:

    TrustIntelligenceService     trust explanation, audit readiness
    RiskIntelligenceService      top risks, single-risk explanation
    EvidenceIntelligenceService  coverage, gaps, control provability
    DashboardService             vendor / privacy / IAM / finding aggregates
    LLMService                   optional prose rewrite of `answer` only

`_match_intent` is still a keyword matcher, not a classifier — the LLM layer
sits strictly after it, so a question that matches no intent never reaches
the LLM and never becomes a fabricated answer.
